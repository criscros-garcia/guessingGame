# The Great RGB Color Game

Have fun guessing what color matchs a given RGB(red, green, blue) code vs
squares displayed.

Red, green, blue channels go from 0 to 255.<br>
Example rgb(0, 255, 0) is a full green color.

You are able to select new colors, and set easy/hard mode.<br>
Easy mode - 3 squares will be displayed.<br>
Hard mode - 6 squares will be displayed.
